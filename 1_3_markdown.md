# Markdown
## Introduction
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text for online use. A Markdown file can also be used as a very powerful notepad to keep track of workflows, files and links.

###### Applications
* [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) (editor for MacOS)
* [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) (editor for Windows)
* [Atom](https://atom.io) - a versatile source code editor with built-in Git
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - a versatile source code editor with built-in Git

## Tasks
* [Create a Markdown file](#task1)
* [Understand Markdown text formatting](#task2)
* [Create anchors and hyperlinks](#task3)
*

Before starting on the tasks just listed, we will need to equip you with a text editor capable of pulling, managing and pushing files to your GitHub repository _and_ editing a wide variety of file formats. As noted in the previous section [(1.2 GitHub)](./1_2_github.md), **GitHub Desktop** is excellent for managing cloned repositories locally, but cannot provide you with an environment for editing files.

You will need to download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Note that the application is free, but will require you to set up a Microsoft account (if you do not already have one).

In order to connect VS Code with your GitHub user profile, you will now need to download the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github) extension 

### <a id="task1">Create a Markdown file</a>
A Markdown file uses the file extension **.md**.

Note that you can insert and link to any hyperlink in a Markdown file.

### <a id="task2">Understanding Markdown text formatting</a>
Markdown is a lightweight markup language, which is easy and intuitive to work with. You can find several guides to Markdown online, but generally they will all cover about the same range of formatting elements as those included on this cheat sheet - [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

The primary structuring element in an **.md**-file are the headers. These are preceded by **#**, **##**, **###** and so on in descending order over six levels.

```
# Header
## Header
### Header
#### Header
##### Header
##### Header
```

Standard formatting elements, such as **bold** and _italics_ are also included.

```
**bold**
_italics_
~~strikethrough~~
~superscript~
```
It is also possible to create a number of different lists, numbered, bullet points, and checkboxes.

```
1. first
2. second
3. third

* first point
* second point
* third point

[ ] first box
[ ] second box
[ ] third box
```

It is also possible to make simple tables in Markdown, using the syntax given below:

```
column1 | column2 | column3
--------|---------|-----------
cell1 | cell4 | cell7
cell2 | cell5 | cell8
cell3 | cell6 | cell9
```

^1} This cannot be a footnote.

### <a id="task3">Create anchors and hyperlinks</a>
Another very useful feature in Markdown documents is the ability to create links internally in the text (also called 'anchors' or 'flags') and hyperlinks to external resources, including files and websites.

A link in Markdown format is generated by placing square brackets **[]** around the linked text, and the link itself in parenthesis **()** immediately after the text to be linked. Thus, a link to your own GitHub user profile could look like this:

```
[My GitHub user profile](https://github.com/yourusername)
```

The same syntax is employed if you want to create a link to another file located in the same directory as the file you are editing. Here, you can use '**./**' before the file name, which will then refer the link to the same directory location. Thus, a link to the README.md file already in your **daa** repository could look like this:

```
[README.md](./README.md)
```
