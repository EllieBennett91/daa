# Introduction
The Digitial Applications in Assyriology Nordic Summer School 2022 is organised by staff at two major research projects, namely [Geomapping Landscapes of Writing (GLoW)](https://www.lingfil.uu.se/research/assyriology/glow/) at Uppsala University and [Ancient Near Eastern Empires (ANEE)](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/ancient-near-eastern-empires) of the University of Helsinki. We have also received  further financial support from the [Ancient Middle Eastern Nordic Network (AMENN)](https://ccrs.ku.dk/education/amenn/), an educational network with the aim to further student exchange in Assyriology, Egyptology, and Middle Eastern Archaeology in Scandinavia.
