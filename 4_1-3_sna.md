# Social Network Analysis

## Introduction
This course block is designed to introduce the main concepts of Social Network Analysis (SNA) in particular, and the relevance of network science for studying the ancient past in general. Through a hands-on tutorial, we will familiarise ourselves with the network analytical software _Gephi_, which is freely available, relatively easy to use and comes with a myriad of tools and measurements for exploring, visualising and analysing network data as network models.

Following an [opening lecture](#task1) on (S)NA, its relevance for historical and archaeological research and _Gephi_, we will:
* consider how we could go about [conceptualising, extracting and modelling data for SNA from an ancient text](#task2) (in groups)
* [Acquaint ourselves with the case study and dataset](#task3) to be exploring in this class (provided by lecturer)
* complete a [hands-on tutorial](#task4) in _Gephi_ (individually)
* collect our thoughts in a [plenary discussion](#task5), sumarising the exercise and reflecting on the potential SNA holds for studying the (distant) past

###### Applications
* [_Gephi_](https://gephi.org/) - network analytical software

## Tasks
In preparation of the course, please install the latest version of _Gephi_ on the computer you will bring to the summerschool, and read [Ch. 6](./Graham_et_al_2016.pdf) of Graham et al. (2016), _Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian's Macroscope_. ALternatively, you may install the software during the 'application dropin' slot on Wednesday 03.08.22, and are welcome to contact Lena (lena.tambs@helsinki.fi) if you run into problems.
