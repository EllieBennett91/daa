# Social Network Analysis

## Introduction
This course block is designed to introduce the main concepts of Social Network Analysis (SNA) in particular, and the relevance of network science for studying the ancient past in general. Through a hands-on tutorial, we will familiarise ourselves with the network analytical software _Gephi_, which is freely available, relatively easy to use and comes with a myriad of tools and measurements for exploring, visualising and analysing network data as network models.

Following an [opening lecture](#task1) on (S)NA, its relevance for historical and archaeological research and _Gephi_, we will:
* consider how we could go about [conceptualising, extracting and modelling data for SNA from an ancient text](#task2) (in groups)
* [Acquaint ourselves with the case study and dataset](#task3) to be exploring in this class (provided by lecturer)
* complete a [hands-on tutorial](#task4) in _Gephi_ (individually)
* collect our thoughts in a [plenary discussion](#task5), sumarising the exercise and reflecting on the potential SNA holds for studying the (distant) past

###### Applications
* [_Gephi_](https://gephi.org/) - a freely available network analytical software

Network analysts use network jargon, that can be quite overwelming and confusing when first approaching the methods. To help you keep track of the concepts, you might find glossaries, like this [list of technical terms](./Tambs_na_glossary.pdf), handy.

## Tasks
In preparation of the course, please install the latest version of _Gephi_ on the computer you will bring to the summer school, and read [Ch. 6](./Graham_et_al_2016.pdf) of Graham et al. (2016), _Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian's Macroscope_. Alternatively, you may install the software during the 'application dropin' slot on Wednesday 03.08.22, and are welcome to contact Lena (lena.tambs@helsinki.fi) if you run into problems.

### <a id="task1">Introduction to SNA and _Gephi_</a>
The morning will start with a lecture introducing you to the main concepts of SNA and giving some examles of how SNA has been used in archaeology and ancient history.

### <a id="task2">Extracting data for SNA from an ancient text</a>
After we have gained an understanding of what SNA is and what it can be useful for, we will try extracting network data from an ancient text in groups. For this conceptual exercise, we will read the text in translation and translate it into a network graph using old-fashioned pen and paper.

### <a id="task3">The case study and dataset to be explored</a>
Next, we will get some information on the social network we will in the hands-on tutorial. The dataset is an interpersonal network extracted from a private family archive from Upper Egyptian town and military camp of [Pathyris](https://www.trismegistos.org/place/1628). The [Archive of Pelaias, son of Eunous alias Nechoutes](https://www.trismegistos.org/arch/detail.php?arch_id=180) consists of thirty Greek, Demotic and bilingual documentary texts written on papyri and ostraca, dated to the late 2nd and early 1st cent. BCE.

### <a id="task4">Hands-on tutorial</a>
For the second practical exercise, please download and follow the [hands-on tutorial](./Tambs_daa_sna_tutorial.pdf).

### <a id="task5">Plenary discussion</a>
To conclude the module, we will share our thoughts on the exercises and discuss the potential of SNA of research in our field(s) in plenum.
