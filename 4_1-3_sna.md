# Social Network Analysis

## Introduction
This course block will introduce the main concepts of Social Network Analysis (SNA) in particular, and the relevance of network science for studying the ancient past in general. Through a hands-on tutorial, we will familiarise ourselves with the network analytical software _Gephi_, which is freely available, relatively easy to use and comes with a myriad of tools and measurements for exploring, visualising and analysing network data as network models.

Following an [opening lecture](#task1) on (S)NA, its relevance for historical and archaeological research and _Gephi_, we will:
* consider how we could go about [extracting data for SNA from an ancient text](#task2) (in groups)
* [Acquaint ourselves with the case study and dataset](#task3) to be exploring in this class (provided by lecturer)
* complete a [hands-on tutorial](#task4) in _Gephi_ (individually)
* collect our thoughts in a [plenary discussion](#task5) on the exercise and potential SNA holds for studying the (distant) past
